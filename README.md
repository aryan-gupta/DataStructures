# libari #

Throughout my programming career, I needed to understand how a data
structure worked or how an algorithm worked. I originally created
this repository because I was going to be taking a data structure
class at my university, little did I know that this would teach me
alot about template programming, SFINAE, and other C++ concepts. 
Later on, I realed that I had put alot of hours into this repo
and it was a big mess, a bunch of header files thrown together. 
So I decided to reorginize the repo and give it an actual name. 
Thus was born libari. 



## What is libari? ##

libari is a number of header files that serves the purpose of
teaching me how various things in std:: namespace work. If you
ever take a peek into the actual code in the ```vector``` header
you will quickly realize that it very cryptographic and there
nameing scheme is obnixious for new reader. libari is a simple
implementation of those functions and classes. 



## How to use libari ##

Don't.

I will repeat, do not use libari in profuction code. The purpose of
libari is for educational purposes only. If you need to use somthing
in here, refer to the boost librarty or the std:: library. 

That being said, if you are an educator or someone who is curious,
by all means feel free to read the code in this repository, feel
free to use this code in your classes but please mention me and my
github account. 

However, if you want to play around with the code, fork the repo
and play around with it. If you find a bug or a better way to do 
somthing, feel free to submit a pull request .



## Versions ##

There was this annecdote that one of my friends told me: 
	He was working on a library, he started out writing the library
	and near the middle of finishing it, he went back to to the code
	he wrote when he first started the library, at that point he
	realized somthing. He had learned so much from writing the 
	library he could see how badly he wrote the code.
When I started out writing out the code for this, I was a n00b and
was just stating out with C++ I took a break from this repo to work
on other stuff, when I came back to working on this, I realized how 
badly I wrote it so I scratched it and started anew. In the repository
there is the "old version" and the current version.
